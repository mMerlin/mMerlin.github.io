For the
<a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>
<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001">Frontend Web Developer NanoDegree</a>,
the “Professional Presence Update 1” after finishing
< a href="http://mmerlin.github.io/resume/">Project 2</a>
suggests reflecting on the code review.&nbsp; Not a lot there to reflect on.&nbsp; Everything is just marked **Meets Specifications**.&nbsp; But …

http://discussions.udacity.com/t/what-is-considered-encapsulation-for-project-2/2729
For **Encapsulation**, the details say
**Some functions are encapsulated in related objects but most functions are on the global scope.**&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; The ONLY function in the global scope, in resumebuilder.js was inName().&nbsp; AND that had a comment header that said it had to stay in the global scope to be able to work with the functions provided in helper.js.&nbsp; Everything else was wrapped in an anonymous function to explicitly keep things out of the global scope.&nbsp; True, the functions, other than the ones used to fill in the sections of the page are not created as properties on an explicit associated object.&nbsp; Instead, they were created in 'function closure scope'.&nbsp; But that is not global scope!&nbsp; At this point in the course, we had not been shown function prototypes yet.&nbsp; That would have been an alternate place to tie the code to.&nbsp; Perhaps that would have been considered proper encapsulation.
