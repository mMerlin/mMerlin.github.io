    <h2>Background Information</h2>
    <h3>Email sent 2015/06.07</h3>

    <p>Bruce,</p>

    <p>Contact Sheet info for Sherlocke Holmes (was Sam Spade).&nbsp; Your post on rpol suggested you
      wanted him to be a fixer.&nbsp; Initially he was an occult detective, and started up a private
      investigations agency as part the retirement package.&nbsp; ATM I do not recall if that was
      supposed to be Sherlocke Investigations, or Holmes Investigations.&nbsp; That could easily
      transpose into Fixer work.&nbsp; I tried to write this to provide hooks to expand to Fixer, but
      I am more familiar / used to him in a detective capacity.&nbsp; After you massage this a bit,
      I’d like a copy back, to help synchronize the back story I am working on.&nbsp; I think some of
      this goes beyond what should be on a contact sheet.&nbsp; I had trouble cutting it down the right
      pieces.</p>

    <p>Note: Sam Spade was 50 years old at the start of the campaign.&nbsp; I do not have start year for
      that handy to set his current age, or how long he has been in Montreal.&nbsp; Plus 3/4 years?</p>

    <p>Sherlocke Holmes, his real legal name, opened a private investigations agency a few years ago,
      and quietly slide into local society.&nbsp; He immediately started appearing at entertainment and
      social events attired as the fictional detective, with historical English gentleman manners to
      match.&nbsp; He soon made a name for himself as a solver of difficult problems.&nbsp; He did not
      publicize his successes.&nbsp; The recipients of his skills often did that for him.&nbsp; As his
      reputation grew, and his contacts widened, he started arranging work to handle situations were
      simply determining what had really occurred, or who was responsible, was not enough.</p>

    <p>A follower of Owl, he seldom tells all he knows, but does not deliberately hold back information
      important to completing contracted work.&nbsp; Those that know him, say he is trustworthy, but
      some find him a bit creepy, quite apart from his full lifestyle emulation of the fictional
      detective.</p>

    <p>His public office has the feel of a historical english sitting or drawing room.&nbsp; It is
      designed to make visitors feel like guests not clients.&nbsp; It has all of the modern office
      technology available, but that is downplayed.&nbsp; There are various fictional detective
      memorabilia included in the decor.&nbsp; Mostly Sherlocke Holmes related, but other fictional
      detectives are featured as well.&nbsp; None of this is explicitly framed or spotlighted.&nbsp;
      It is all part of the ambiance, so the place feels lived in, not like a museum.</p>

    <p>The office is not the only place to meet him.&nbsp; He travels the gamut of what society
      provides, from the lowest dive bar to near the top of society circles.</p>

      <li>Languages: English(N), Japanese, Sioux, Spanish, several Linguasofts for more</li>
      <li>knowledge (rating 1) Chemistry(Drugs), Drug Sources (Medicinal), Data Sources(Biographical
        Information)</li>
      <li>The fictional detectives knowledge is boosted by a knowsoft with emphasis on Sherlocke Holmes:
        explicitly studied to fit the adopted persona</li>
      <li>the original In Debt quality was swapped (GM approved) for Prejudiced, Specific,
        Aztechnology</li>
      <li>Lost Love (Significant Other)</li>
      <li>uses:? contacts/introduction across society 'class' boundaries</li>
      <li>Some Robin Hooding tendencies, but tries to make sure *someone* pays, when the client can’t
        afford the 'going rate'.&nbsp; With the retirement permanent lifestyle, he can afford to be
        picky about the work he does / accepts.&nbsp; At least as far as monetary compensation is
        concerned.</li>
      <li>Prior to Montreal, per the ID and persona provided with the permanent lifestyle, he was
        discharged as cured from a mental hospital.</li>
      <li>bottom to top of society, he does not 'put on airs'.&nbsp; He also does not do much in the
        way of kow-towing or boot licking.&nbsp; He treats almost everyone with respect, as
        equals.&nbsp; Of course, being a dwarf mage, he does not have much use for Humanis, or anti
        magic groups.&nbsp; That extends to other visible groups, whether metatype or avocation (like
        TM).</li>
