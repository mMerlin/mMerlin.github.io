Bruce,

Contact Sheet info for Sherlocke Holmes (was Sam Spade).  Your post on rpol suggested you wanted him to be a fixer.  Initially he was an occult detective, and started up a private investigations agency as part the retirement package.  ATM I do not recall if that was supposed to be Sherlocke Investigations, or Holmes Investigations.  That could easily transpose into Fixer work.  I tried to write this to provide hooks to expand to Fixer, but I am more familiar / used to him in a detective capacity.  After you massage this a bit, I'd like a copy back, to help synchronize the back story I am working on.  I think some of this goes beyond what should be on a contact sheet.  I had trouble cutting it down the right pieces.

Note: Sam Spade was 50 years old at the start of the campaign.  I do not have start year for that handy to set his current age, or how long he has been in Montreal.  Plus 3/4 years?

Sherlocke Holmes, his real legal name, opened a private investigations agency a few years ago, and quietly slide into local society.  He immediately started appearing at entertainment and social events attired as the fictional detective, with historical English gentleman manners to match.  He soon made a name for himself as a solver of difficult problems.  He did not publicize his successes.  The recipients of his skills often did that for him.  As his reputation grew, and his contacts widened, he started arranging work to handle situations were simply determining what had really occurred, or who was responsible, was not enough.

A follower of Owl, he seldom tells all he knows, but does not deliberately hold back information important to completing contracted work.  Those that know him, say he is trustworthy, but some find him a bit creepy, quite apart from his full lifestyle emulation of the fictional detective.

His public office has the feel of a historical english sitting or drawing room.  It is designed to make visitors feel like guests not clients.  It has all of the modern office technology available, but that is downplayed.  There are various fictional detective memorabilia included in the decor.  Mostly Sherlocke Holmes related, but other fictional detectives are featured as well.  None of this is explicitly framed or spotlighted.  It is all part of the ambiance, so the place feels lived in, not like a museum.

The office is not the only place to meet him.  He travels the gamut of what society provides, from the lowest dive bar to near the top of society circles.

- The fictional detectives knowledge is boosted by a knowsoft with emphasis on Sherlocke Holmes: explicitly studied to fit the adopted persona
- the original In Debt quality was swapped (GM approved) for Prejudiced, Specific, Aztechnology
- Lost Love (Significant Other)
- uses:? contacts/introduction across society 'class' boundaries
- Some Robin Hooding tendencies, but tries to make sure *someone* pays, when the client cant afford the 'going rate'.  With the retirement permanent lifestyle, he can afford to be picky about the work he does / accepts.  At least as far as monetary compensation is concerned.
- Prior to Montreal, per the ID and persona provided with the permanent lifestyle, he was discharged as cured from a mental hospital.
- bottom to top of society, he does not 'put on airs'.  He also does not do much in the way of kow-towing or boot licking.  He treats almost everyone with respect, as equals.  Of course, being a dwarf mage, he does not have much use for Humanis, or anti magic groups.  That extends to other visible groups, whether metatype or avocation (like TM).
