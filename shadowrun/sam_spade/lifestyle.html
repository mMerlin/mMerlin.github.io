### Base
High Lifestyle equivalent, or 20 SR4 advanced lifestyle points, for a permanent lifestyle on a legal SIN

Home setup to be a (conceptual) recreation of the fictional Sherlocke Holmes living spaces.  Upgraded / updated to use current technology, but with the feel / ambiance of what the literature shows for 221B Baker Street.  Specifically the sitting room.  Modified by the needs of a mage (magical lodge).
<quote Arthur Conan Doyle, A Study in Scarlet, 1887>
We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows.

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/221B_Baker_Street) says
<quote>In the United Kingdom, postal addresses with a number followed by a letter may indicate a separate address within a larger, often residential building. Baker Street in Holmes' time was a high-class residential district, and Holmes' apartment was probably part of a Georgian terrace.</quote>

For (my) purposes of the lifestyle concept, an apartment suite is difficult to reconcile with the extended below ground workspace.  Row housing is possible, if that is compatible with the middle and high lifestyle ratings being used to fit the rest.  A large duplex/4-plex would be usable.  I started the concept using a single family dwelling built on a hill side, where the front door was separated from the street by only the sidewalk, and the back dropped sharply to have a walk out basement, and garage entrance from the back alley.  Some yard space in the back for garden party situations.  The back facing south, to get sun for a bit of green space.

### Magical Lodge
Mana lodges are not limited to the magic rating of the mage.  In fact, they need to be at a higher rating to be able to use for learning the next level.  They need materials and time/ritual to create and increase.  Sherlocke can afford both, so a force 10 Magical lodge seems about right for now.

SR4A194 says Mana Lodges are approximately force meters in radius.  10 meter radius comes to just over 314 square meters (floor space), with a total (above and below) height of 20 meters.  High lifestyle necessities RC155 goes to only 300 sq m total.  Going to need to add Workplace RC162 quality as part of the base lifestyle to get enough room.  That quality increases space component of Necessities by 2 levels.  Next above High is Luxury, which says mansion with extensive grounds.  Unless the base necessities is dropped to medium, there is going to be LOTS of space.  Even Medium necessities, with workplace, is going to be luxury (RC156) class space, which seems to start at 750 sq m.  The simplest way to incorporate that amount of space with the rest of the (approximately) high lifestyle, and Holmes emulation, seemed to be to go down to caves.  That also fits with the bat cave / owl's nest concept, and gives benefits of thick earth walls for a barrier.

<quote Chaos Magic Tradition (SM37)>
By nature, this magic system is a hodge-podge of styles and trappings that drinks from numerous sources. A chaos ritual circle might include qabbalistic, runic, and even shamanic design elements, and their lodges range from hermetic-style libraries to stone circles to cavernous basements decked in elaborate Aboriginal drawings.

5 Aspected Domain
1 Workplace (Luxury+ for space)
2 Privacy Screen (Astral)

A possible alternative would be something like a warehouse, that has been (partially) converted to middle to high lifestyle apartment suites.  With the caves, it makes sense to include an escape tunnel.  With a warehouse, that is not such an obvious enhancement.  Also the Corporate Owned negative does not make much sense.

### NOTES


#### Lifestyle qualities incompatible with concept
Astral Repellant
Commercial Zone
Easy-going Landlord


Lifestyle qualities that do not apply to the Holmes home
Trigger-Happy Landlord.  Does not apply with a permanent lifestyle.
Rough Neighborhood, Worse Neighbors.  Sherlocke does not 'belong' with those categories.  For the legal SIN, public persona / emulation, he needs to be able to accept legitimate visitors, without them being terrified.  He needs to be seen as an upstanding (though not model) citizen.
Pest Magnet and Unsource/Unsafe, Household Gremlins, Defective CHN would also be counter to the intended visible environment.  The same for No Forwarding Address and Sprite Magnet.  Lax security would seem to be counter to corporate owned.
Network Bottleneck would be pushing things, on top of the no privacy.  With the (re)aspected domain, Haunted might be reasonable, but seems a bit extreme for the combination.
Rad Pad.  The interior is themed, but not the exterior.
Astral Repellant is not compatible with Aspected Domain
Easy-going Landlord makes no sense with a permanent lifestyle
Free Access does no seem compaticle with No Privacy (matrix)
Well Made seems redundant for Necessities at High lifestyle level
Commercial Zone, No neighbors

Comforts: 4
Entertainment: 3
Necessities: 3
Neighborhood: 3
Security: 4

3 Escape Tunnel
1 Workplace (Luxury+ for space)
-3 Corporate Owned RC163
-2 Living by Committee or Living with Parents : Watson controls things a lot

Iffy: This Isn’t Big Bob’s Autos; Nosy Neighbors
Black Hole looks interesting.  With the extensive memorabilia on display (but not 'displayed'), things would easily disapear in the 'clutter'.  However, how would that mix with a catalog spell?  Would things vanish from that sense, or show up, but can not be located?

My vision for the home means that neither Privacy Screen or No Privacy (physical) make sense.  With the intended basement / underground magical lodge, privacy screen (astral) seemed appropriate (living earth makes a good barrier, even without the lodge mana barrier).  I balanced that with no privacy (matrix)
