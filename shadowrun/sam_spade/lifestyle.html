		<h1>Permanent Lifestyle</h1></article>
	  <h2>Base</h2>
	  <p>High Lifestyle equivalent, or 20 SR4 advanced lifestyle points, for a permanent lifestyle on a
			legal SIN</p>

		<p>The home is setup to be a (conceptual) recreation of the fictional Sherlocke Holmes living
			spaces.&nbsp; Upgraded / updated to incorporate current technology, but with the feel / ambiance of
			what the literature shows for 221B Baker Street.&nbsp; Specifically the sitting room.&nbsp; Modified
			by the needs of a mage (magical lodge).</p>

		<p><cite>Arthur Conan Doyle, A Study in Scarlet, 1887</cite></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B, Baker Street, of which
				he had spoken at our meeting. They consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single
				large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/221B_Baker_Street">wikipedia</a>
		<blockquote>
			<p>In the United Kingdom, postal addresses with a number followed by a letter may indicate a
				separate address within a larger, often residential building. Baker Street in Holmes' time was a
				high-class residential district, and Holmes' apartment was probably part of a Georgian
				terrace.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>For (my) purposes of the lifestyle concept, an apartment suite is difficult to reconcile with the
			extended below ground workspace.&nbsp; Row housing is possible, if that is compatible with the
			middle and high lifestyle ratings being used to fit the rest.&nbsp; A large duplex/4-plex would be
			usable.&nbsp; The converted insdustrial facility seems to work as well.&nbsp; I started the concept
			using a single family dwelling built on a hill side, where the
			front door was separated from the street by only the sidewalk, and the back dropped sharply to have
			a walk out basement, and garage entrance from the back alley.&nbsp; Some yard space in the back for
			garden party situations.&nbsp; The back facing south, to get sun for a bit of green space.</p>

		<h2>Magical Lodge</h2>
		<p>Magical lodges are not limited to the magic rating of the mage.&nbsp; In fact, they need to be at
			a higher rating to be able to use for learning the next level.&nbsp; They need materials and
			time/ritual to create and increase.&nbsp; Sherlocke can afford both, so a force 10 Magical lodge
			seems about right for now.</p>

		<p><cite>SR4A194</cite> says Mana Lodges are approximately force meters in radius.&nbsp; 10 meter
			radius comes to just over 314 square meters (floor space), with a total (above and below) height
			of 20 meters.&nbsp; High lifestyle necessities <cite>RC155</cite> goes to only 300 sq m
			total.&nbsp; Going to	need to add Workplace <cite>RC162</cite> quality as part of the base
			lifestyle to get enough room.&nbsp; That quality increases space component of Necessities by 2
			levels.&nbsp; Next above High is Luxury, which says mansion with extensive grounds.&nbsp; Unless
			the base necessities is dropped to medium, there is going to be LOTS of space.&nbsp; Even Medium
			necessities, with workplace, is going to be luxury <cite>RC156</cite> class space, which seems to
			start at 750 sq m.&nbsp; The simplest way to incorporate that amount of space with the rest of
			the (approximately) high lifestyle, and Holmes emulation, seemed to be to go down to caves.&nbsp;
			That also fits with the bat cave / owl's nest concept, and gives benefits of thick earth walls for a
			barrier.</p>

		<p><cite>Chaos Magic Tradition (SM37)</cite></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>By nature, this magic system is a hodge-podge of styles and trappings that drinks from numerous
				sources. A chaos ritual circle might include qabbalistic, runic, and even shamanic design
				elements, and their lodges range from hermetic-style libraries to stone circles to cavernous
				basements decked in elaborate Aboriginal drawings.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<ul>
			<li>5 Aspected Domain</li>
			<li>1 Workplace (Luxury+ for space)</li>
			<li>2 Privacy Screen (Astral)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>A possible alternative would be something like a warehouse, that has been (partially) converted to
			middle to high lifestyle apartment suites.&nbsp; With the caves, it makes sense to include an
			escape tunnel.&nbsp; With a warehouse, that is not such an obvious enhancement.&nbsp; Also the
			Corporate Owned negative does not make as much sense.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>5 Aspected Domain</li>
			<li>1 Workplace (Luxury+ for space)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>The Owl’s Nest</h2>
		<p>Cave system below a corporate gated community.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Comforts: 4</li>
			<li>Entertainment: 3</li>
			<li>Necessities: 4</li>
			<li>Neighborhood: 3</li>

			<li>Crash Pad: -1</li>
			<li>Living by Committee: -2</li>
			<li>No Privacy: -2 (matrix)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Minor variation: decrease Necessities from 4 to 3, increase Security from 3 to 4.&nbsp; That would
			reduce the total space to the equivalent of Luxury, which should still be more than enough.&nbsp; It
			does also reduce the potential for entertaining guests that fits the Holmes persona.&nbsp;

		<h2>NOTES</h2>

		<h4>Lifestyle qualities incompatible with concept</h4>
		<dl>
			<dt>Astral Repellant</dt>
				<dd>not compatible with Aspected Domain</dd>
			<dt>Commercial Zone</dt>
				<dd>maximum of 7 lifestyle points</dd>
			<dt>Easy-going Landlord</dt>
			<dt>Trigger-Happy Landlord</dt>
				<dd>Does not make sense for a permanent lifestyle</dd>
			<dt>Inconspicuous Hosing</dt>
				<dd>Holmes is expected to have some regular guests over.&nbsp; Otherwise the work done for <thead>
					sitting room would be estentially wasted.&nbsp; Plus, this would not be compatible with Crash
					Pad.</dd>
			<dt>Rad Pad</dt>
				<dd>All theming is in the interior.&nbsp; Nothing unusual should be visible from outside.</dd>
			<dt></dt>
				<dd></dd>
		</dl>

		<h4>Lifestyle qualities that do not make sense to take</h4>
		<dl>
			<dt>In Tune</dt>
			<dt>Resonance Well</dt>
				<dd>No Technomancer in residence</dd>
			<dt>Well Made</dt>
				<dd>Seems redundant with necessities rating of High (or even Medium)</dd>
			<dt>Living with Parents</dt>
				<dd>Watson could be an equivalent, but committee makes more sense</dd>
			<dt>Worse Neighbors</dt>
			<dt>Rough Neighborhood</dt>
				<dd>For the legal SIN, public persona / emulation, Sherlocke needs to be able to accept legitimate visitors, without them being terrified.&nbsp; He needs to be seen as an upstanding (though not model) citizen.&nbsp; These would interfere too much with that.</dd>
			<dt>Defective CHN</dt>
			<dt>Household Gremlins</dt>
			<dt>No Forwarding Address</dt>
			<dt>Pest Magnet</dt>
			<dt>Sprite Magnet</dt>
			<dt>Unsound/Unsafe</dt>
				<dd>Also counter to the intended visible environment</dd>
		</dl>

		<h4>Thoughts on other lifestyle qualities</h4>
		<dl>
			<dt>Homegrown Farming</dt>
				<dd>Nice, but other things are more interesting</dd>
			<dt>Feng Shui</dt>
				<dd>(currently) affected technical skills would be only computer and data search.&nbsp; Not
					worth the cost.</dd>
			<dt>Privacy Screen</dt>
				<dd>If the magical lodge has thick earth wall, astral privacy make sense.&nbsp; Anything else
					would be just for tuning the lifestyle concept for the story.</dd>
			<dt>Black Hole</dt>
				<dd>This looks interesting.&nbsp; With the extensive memorabilia on display (but not
					'displayed'), things would easily disappear in the 'clutter'.&nbsp; However, how would that mix
					with an active catalog spell?&nbsp; Would things vanish from that sense, or show up, but can not
					be located?</p>
			<dt>Poor Condition</dt>
				<dd>This is a viable option for the converted industrial facility.&nbsp; Being repurposed, it may
					not be quite adequate as a residence.</dd>
			<dt>Perfect Roommate</dt>
				<dd>Mrs. Watson could have useful skills that would qualify for this.</dd>
			<dt>Coporate Owned</dt>
				<dd>Make sense for a gated community.&nbsp; Less so for <b>typical</b> residential
					conversions.</dd>
			<dt>Crash Pad</dt>
				<dd>With the pesona of Holmes, unexpected acquaintances dropping in fits</dd>
			<dt>No Neighbors</dt>
				<dd>Hard to justify with any of the lifestyle scenarios being used.&nbsp; The base lifestyle is
					high.&nbsp; He does not have the resouces of Bruce Wayne to have a mansion isolated from
					neighbors.</dd>
			<dt>Living by Committee</dt>
				<dd>This can be justified for most scenarios.&nbsp; It does not really fit with the goal of
					emulating the Holmes lifestyle, but it is not too disruptive.&nbsp; The official Mrs. Watson
					would probably approve.&nbsp; It would force Sherlocke to keep involved.</dd>
			<dt>Haunted</dt>
				<dd>Starting from a background count that is geomanced into an aspected domain, this would be
					easily explained.&nbsp; Not so easy if the story is a minor lei line junction point.&nbsp;
					This would also be difficult to fit into the goal of some entertaining to
					(indirectly/subtly) show off the memorabilia.</dd>

			<dt>Concerned Neighbors</dt>
			<dt>Friendly Neighbors</dt>
			<dt>Free Access</dt>
			<dt>Hasty Exit</dt>
			<dt>Quiet Neighborhood</dt>
			<dt>Security Conscious</dt>
			<dt>AI in Residence</dt>
			<dt>Ambusher’s Delight</dt>
			<dt>Green Plan</dt>
			<dt>Lax Security</dt>
			<dt>Network Bottleneck</dt>
			<dt>Nosy Neighbors</dt>
			<dt>No Privacy</dt>
