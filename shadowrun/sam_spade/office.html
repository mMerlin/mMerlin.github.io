	<article><h1>The Office(s)</h1>
		<p>Sherlocke has an office at home, but the general public is not going to see much of that.&nbsp;
			People with the need, or an invitation and either a valid SIN, or the ability to negotiate the
			level of security for the area can try for admittance.&nbsp; Once there, they can admire the
			replication / emulation of the sitting-room described in the literature, and shown in various
			forms on multiple trid (and earlier) shows while visiting, or discussing business.&nbsp; This
			is a living space, but here are many authentic and copied Sherlocke Holmes memorabilia items to be
			seen, mixed with collectibles related to other fictional detectives.&nbsp; The items are not on
			display as they would be in a museum.&nbsp; The more expensive items are discretely protected from
			damage, but the layout has been designed to simply incorporate them into the living space.&nbsp;
			This is not a no tech throwback environment either.&nbsp; AR is used to enhance and extend the
			room.&nbsp; Those interested can open unobtrusive deerstalker hat and pipe ARO icons to view the
			history of the physical and virtual items.</p>

		<p>The official office for Sherlocke Investigations is similar.&nbsp; It too is based on the sitting
			room.&nbsp; There is no physical desk to sit at.&nbsp; Instead, comfortable replica period
			furniture is provided.&nbsp; Those without an appointment will be greeted by a holo projected
			secretary in period costume.&nbsp; There will typically be evidence of some mundane task that the
			Lady of the house interrupted to greet the guest.</p>

		<p>The office area is magically warded, and wi-fi blocked for privacy.&nbsp; Holmes does not spend a
			lot of time in the office, except for scheduled meetings.&nbsp; Instead, he is usually out working
			on something or other, or just talking to 'interesting' people from any walk of life.</p>
