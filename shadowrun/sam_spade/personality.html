	<article><h1>Personality | Persona</h1>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Also give me the blurb on his Lost Love again and a general description of his "office" that he
				works out of. IIRC, I set him up as a low-level fixer or news reporter in Montreal.&nbsp; Correct
				me if I am wrong, it's on the other system and I don't plan to boot that up.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Actually he got an official / legal name change to "Sherlocke Holmes" (or was that supposed to be
			"Sherlock"?), and opened a detective agency.</p>

		<p>Along with the permanent high lifestyle came a female assistant / guard / manager (keeper) named
			(Mrs) Watson.&nbsp; The story was that someone just released (cured) from some sort of mental
			institute with rich family/estate/inheritance (and Sherlock Holmes fixation) provided the SIN and
			went to live on a beach someplace.&nbsp; Officially Watson is his 'nurse' to help him readjust to
			regular society, but in reality seems more like his keeper provided by the benefactor that provided
			the lifestyle.</p>

		<p>That would still be compatible with being a fixer.</p>

		<p>Lost Love: While on an out of town case for his previous (legal) employer, his (mostly) live in
			Significant Other vanished.&nbsp; No message, no trace.&nbsp; Just not there when he got back, and
			all personal property gone.&nbsp; They were a solid item (for about a year and a half), and he
			discounted the possibility that she just decided it was time to move on without even saying
			goodbye.&nbsp; He suspected his then boss of arranging the disappearance, but no proof.&nbsp;
			All of his research came to exactly nothing.&nbsp; The cleanness / thoroughness of the
			disappearance suggests a professional job.&nbsp; Right up to corp or government 'spook'
			operation.</p>

		<p>The public personality is a deliberate imitation of Holmes (minus the drugs).&nbsp; Zo√© Heritage
			Line, Victorian-era colonial gentleman for public events, still (english) stylish, but more
			coarse/sturdy clothing when traveling in less 'upper crust' circles.&nbsp; The fictional Holmes
			was quite at home, and could be found in many settings and levels of society.&nbsp; The same
			here.</p>

		<p>From the stories, Holmes lived a middle/upper life.&nbsp; He did not seem to be 'upper crust', but
			he did manage to run in those circles, while still being approachable, and have contacts / friends
			with people right down to the bottom levels of society.&nbsp; At home, like Holmes, some 'lower
			class' people make to the back door.&nbsp; Not because he insists on it, but because they do not
			wish to be seen.&nbsp; I used that as an excuse to add the crash pad negative lifestyle
			quality.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>detail oriented</li>
			<li>quiet (compared to fictional Holmes)</li>
			<li>listens well</li>
			<li>has an upgraded Cyberspace Design dragonfly with added sensors, Empathy software, Lie Detection
				Software, more</li>
			<li>has an emotitoy styled to be mistaken for a magical fetish</li>
		</ul>
