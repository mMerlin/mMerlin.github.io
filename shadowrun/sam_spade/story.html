		<h1>The Story</h1>
		<p>Not 'satisfied' with the blah high lifestyle surroundings supplied as the base retirement high
			lifestyle, Sherlocke went exploring for alternatives in the area.&nbsp; He has an interest knowledge
			skill for Fictional Detectives.&nbsp; He knows what the 'Bat Cave' is.&nbsp; For himself, he wanted
			an 'Owl’s Nest' (burrowing owl, Owl mentor sprite <cite>SM182</cite> :) )</p>

		<p>As a psychic detective, knowing what is around can be very useful.&nbsp; The last spell learned,
			shortly after being 'retired' was Spatial Sense (SM168).&nbsp; Some straight forward research
			located some potential (lifestyle) compatible areas that also had the potential for reasonable large
			underground cave systems.&nbsp; There were even some hints about caves that had been used for
			smuggling	in past centuries.&nbsp; With the aid of a Spirit of Earth, and the spatial sense, he went
			exploring.&nbsp; It took some time, but a few candidates were found.&nbsp; Nothing 'ready made', but
			with some (spirit) work, things could be connected.&nbsp; One location stood out.&nbsp; One of the
			caves aligned with the juncture of a couple of minor lei lines.&nbsp; The location had some
			disadvantages too though.&nbsp; The residence that would allow access was in a corp gated community
			with cameras everywhere.&nbsp; Since he has to 'be' Holmes, Sam figures he can live with that.&nbsp;
			It will just be an extra reminder that his whole public life is 'in costume'.</p>

		<p>Some serious negotiations later, with assistance from Mrs Watson (and probably her bosses), he
			(actually they) moved in and he got to work.&nbsp; Using spirits, the actual physical access
			modifications were not that difficult.&nbsp; Time consuming yes.&nbsp; While that was going on, he
			had some more research and negotiations to do.&nbsp; The mana at the junction was not quite
			'right'.&nbsp; It interfered more than helped his magic use.&nbsp; He had to locate a geomancer
			chaos mage willing to put in some time to tune it before he could use it, and do the sculpting
			needed to keep it compatible.</p>

		<p>Now though, he has a <a href="./lifestyle.html">private space</a>, where he can get away from
			everyone, to work on his magic, with plenty of extra space for any storage or other workspace for
			the purely detective / forensics work.</p>

		<p>discussion: The "Owl’s Nest" does not *have* to be secret.&nbsp; It is not advertised, and the
			extent of the space is definitely downplayed.&nbsp; Any 'escape tunnel' aspect of course is not
			public.&nbsp; With the story, adding escape tunnel made sense.&nbsp; Though it did complicate
			balancing the qualities.&nbsp; Having a secret entrance/exit is an advantage for any shadow work,
			whether as a Fixer or detective.&nbsp; If using the cave system story, it does not make sense to
			<b>NOT</b> include the escape tunnel, and that environment seems to require an astral privacy
			shield.</p>

		<h3>Other variation</h3>

		<p>Looking for a place that was big enough for the magical lodge, Sherlocke found a warehouse on the
			edge of an old (now abandoned) light industrial area.&nbsp; Someone had taken the time to convert
			and renovate much of the building into suites of apartments, with all of the modern amenities and
			security.&nbsp; It was not quite the nicest area, but almost everything else seemed made to
			order.&nbsp; A secure high end apartment, with a large enough space for the lodge on an uncoverted
			lower level.&nbsp; A bit of additional renovations, and that area could be accessed directly from
			the bottom level of the suite.

		<p>discussion: I like the cave with Owl's nest.&nbsp; The warehouse works too, and could still add
			the Escape Tunnel there.&nbsp; Doing the renovations to get direct access could have discovered /
			added the discrete entrance / exit from the building.&nbsp; Just harder to justify Corporate-Owned
			to balance things out.&nbsp; The final variation on the <a href="./lifestyle.html">lifestyle</a>
			page looks interesting.&nbsp; Possibly over-complex setup, but it does fit well with the emulated
			Holmes lifestyle.</p>

		<p>The customized dragonfly drone had the exotic meelee weapon 'claws' replaced by a squirt
			gun.&nbsp; The only way I could find to enter that in chummer, was a weapon mount and the Super
			Squirt.&nbsp; The range is only supposed to be about a meter, and the clip is probably ony a few
			shots.  On the same order as a holdout.  Maybe 5 shots.</p>
