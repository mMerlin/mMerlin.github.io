Not 'satisfied' with the blah high lifestyle surroundings supplied as the base retirement high lifestyle, Sherlocke went exploring for alternatives in the area.  He has an interest knowledge skill for Fictional Detectives.  He knows what the 'Bat Cave' is.  For himself, he wanted an 'Owl’s Nest' (burrowing owl, Owl mentor sprite SM182 :) )

As a psychic detective, knowing what is around can be very useful.  The last spell learned, shortly after being 'retired' was Spatial Sense (SM168).  Some straight forward research located some potential (lifestyle) compatible areas that also had the potential for reasonable large underground cave systems.  There were even some hints about caves that had been used for smuggling in past centuries.  With the aid of a Spirit of Earth, and the spatial sense, he went exploring.  It took some time, but a few candidates were found.  Nothing 'ready made', but with some (spirit) work, things could be connected.  One location stood out.  One of the caves aligned with the juncture of a couple of minor lei lines.  The location had some disadvantages too though.  The residence that would allow access was in a corp gated community with cameras everywhere.  Since he has to 'be' Holmes, Sam figures he can live with that.  It will just be an extra reminder that his whole public life is 'in costume'.

Some serious negotiations later, with assistance from Mrs Watson (and probably her bosses), he (actually they) moved in and he got to work.  Using spirits, the actual physical access modifications were not that difficult.  Time consuming yes.  While that was going on, he had some more research and negotiations to do.  The mana at the junction was not quite 'right'.  It interfered more than helped his magic use.  He had to locate a geomancer chaos mage willing to put in some time to tune it before he could use it, and do the sculpting needed to keep it compatible.

Now though, he has a private space, where he can get away from everyone, to work on his magic, with plenty of extra space for any storage of other workspace for the purely detective / forensics work.

Workable variation: decrease Necessities from 4 to 3, increase Security from 3 to 4.  That would reduce the total space to the equivalent of Luxury, which should still be more than enough.  It does also reduce the potential for entertaining guests that fits the Holmes persona.  Descriptions for Middle and High RC155

discussion: The "Owl’s Nest" does not *have* to be secret.  It is not advertised, and the extent of the space is definitely downplayed.  The 'escape tunnel' aspect of course is not public.  With the story, adding escape tunnel made sense.  Though it did complicate balancing the qualities.  Having a secret entrance/exit is an advantage for any shadow work, whether as a Fixer or detective.  If using the cave system story, it does not make sense to **NOT** include the escape tunnel, and that environment seems to require an astral privacy shield.

#### Other variation

Looking for a place that was big enough for the magical lodge, Sherlocke found a warehouse on the edge of an old (now abandoned) light industrial area.  Someone had taken the time to convert and renovate much of the building into suites of apartments, with all of the modern amenities and security.  It was not quite the nicest area, but almost everything else seemed made to order.  A secure high end apartment, with a large enough space for the lodge on an uncoverted lower level.  A bit of additional renovations, and that area could be accessed directly from the lower level of the apartment.

discussion: I like the cave with Owl's nest.  The warehouse works too, and could still add the Escape Tunnel there.  Doing the renovations to get direct access could have discovered / added the discrete entrance / exit from the building.  Just harder to justify Corporate-Owned to balance things out.
