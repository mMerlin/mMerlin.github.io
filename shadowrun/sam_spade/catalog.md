SM165 Catalog (Active, Area)
Type: P • Range: T • Duration: S • DV: (F÷2)+2

Quickened force 7 Catalog Spell: After research, gathered a range of items with varying object resistants for calibration, then repeated the spell each day until the more resistant objects were being cataloged, then quickened it with 9 karma, to give it a bit of extra resistance to breakage.

Cast 12d6 : Magic 7, Spellcasting 3, Aspected Domain 2, Force 7
Drain 5
Resist 14d6 : Will 5, Logic 5, Limited 2, Aspected Domain 2

As long as get 3 hits on the resist, the spell could be attempted twice each 'session' (before resting).  Unless the 2nd attempt would use a descending pool.

SR4A205/6 "Note that Counterspelling cannot be used to “defend” against the
sense provided by passive Detection spells, but it can be used to dispel
sustained or quickened passive Detection spells."

SR4A185 Counterspelling also allows a magician to dispel a sustained or quickened spell, canceling its effect. The character must be on the same plane, must be able to perceive the spell she is targeting, and must use
a Complex Action.
** what does "perceive the spell" mean in the context of an active area detection spell?
Trying to dispell the intended catalog spell could 'hurt'.  The opposed dice to the counterspelling would be Force 7 plus Magic 7 plus (at least) Karma 7.  Even if no net hits, the drain would be 5.  Physical with less than magic 7.
