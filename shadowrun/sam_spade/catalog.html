    <h3>SM165 Catalog (Active, Area)</h3>
    <p>Type: P • Range: T • Duration: S • DV: (F÷2)+2

    <p>Quickened force 7 Catalog Spell: After research, gathered a range of items with varying object
      resistences for calibration, then repeated the spell each day until the more resistant objects
      were being cataloged, then quickened it with 9 karma, to give it a bit of extra resistance to
      breakage.</p>

    <p>Cast 12d6 @ force 7: Magic 7, Spellcasting 3, Aspected Domain 2/br>
      Drain 5</br>
      Resist 16d6 : Will 5, Logic 5, Limited Spell 2, Aspected Domain 2, Centering 2</p>

    <p>As long as get 3 hits on the resist, the spell could be attempted twice each 'session' (before
      resting).&nbsp; Unless the 2nd attempt would use a descending pool for retrying.&nbsp; Would
			dropping a spell and recasting count as a retry when the previous was not a failure?&nbsp; Just
			less powerful than wanted.</p>

    <p>SR4A205/6 "Note that Counterspelling cannot be used to “defend” against the
    sense provided by passive Detection spells, but it can be used to dispel
    sustained or quickened passive Detection spells."</p>
