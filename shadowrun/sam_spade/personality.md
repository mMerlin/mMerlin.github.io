Also give me the blurb on his Lost Love again and a general description of his "office" that he works out of. IIRC, I set him up as a low-level fixer or news reporter in Montreal.  Correct me if I am wrong, it's on the other system and I don't plan to boot that up.

Actually he got an official / legal name change to "Sherlocke Holmes" (or was that supposed to be "Sherlock"?), and opened a detective agency.

Along with the permanent high lifestyle came a female assistant / guard / manager (keeper) named (Mrs) Watson.  The story was that someone just released (cured) from some sort of mental institute with rich family/estate/inheritance (and Sherlock Holmes fixation) provided the SIN and went to live on a beach someplace.  Officially Watson is his 'nurse' to help him readjust to regular society, but in reality seems more like his keeper provided by the benefactor that provided the lifestyle.

That would still be compatible with being a fixer.

Lost Love: While on an out of town case for his previous (legal) employer, his (mostly) live in Significant Other vanished.  No message, no trace.  Just not there when he got back, and all personal property gone.  They were a solid item (for about a year and a half), and he discounted the possibility that she just decided it was time to move on without even saying goodbye.  He suspected his then boss of arranging the disappearance, but no proof.  All of his research came to exactly nothing.  The cleanness / thoroughness of the disappearance suggests a professional job.  Right up to corp or government 'spook' operation.

The public personality is a deliberate imitation of Holmes (minus the drugs).  Zo√© Heritage Line, Victorian-era colonial gentleman for public events, still (english) stylish, but more coarse/sturdy clothing when traveling in less 'upper crust' circles.  The fictional Holmes was quite at home, and could be found in many settings and levels of society.  The same here.

From the stories, Holmes lived a middle/upper life.  He did not seem to be 'upper crust', but he did manage to run in those circles, while still being approachable, and have contacts / friends with people right down to the bottom levels of society.  At home, like Holmes, some 'lower class' people make to the back door.  Not because he insists on it, but because they do not wish to be seen.  I used that as an excuse to add the crash pad negative lifestyle quality.
