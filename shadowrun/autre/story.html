	<article><h1>L’Autre</h1>
		<p>The (initial) story for the simsense vertigo, is that his mind has not quite adjusted to the resonance yet.&nbsp; He is not quite in phase / in sync with it and the matrix.&nbsp; An alternate story, that does not have a standard negative quality, is that he is not yet properly filtering the mass of matrix signals.&nbsp; The dicepool penalty is really from being distracted by the volume of minutia he is trying to process.&nbsp; Same penalty, but totally different cause.</p>

		<p>L’Autre has always been SINless.&nbsp; He grew up totally off grid, in the slums.&nbsp; When he expressed, and understood some of what that meant, he saw a chance to improve his life.&nbsp; There were risks, but just staying alive in the slums was hard to do too.&nbsp; He started (privately) exploring what his new abilities let him do, learning how to manipulate the matrix to his own advantage.&nbsp; He could live day to day by convincing various systems to supply his basic needs.&nbsp; He moved off of the street, but he wanted more.&nbsp; Oh so much more!</p>


		<p>Unable to fully join the official society without an id, he studies how the validation of SINs works, and why a fake ID does not pass depending on the checking depth.&nbsp; He finds there are multiple causes for an id to be flagged as invalid.&nbsp; He works through each of them, looking for ways to minimize the likelihood of detection.&nbsp; He does not have the skills, contacts, or backdoor access needed to do it himself, but he comes to understand what might pass most validations, short of a high level security check.&nbsp; What is needed is a complete personal history, with matching physical information.&nbsp; Nearly impossible to create, but it might be possible to take over an existing id.&nbsp; If the original owner of the id is not around trying to use it as well.</p>

		<p>Stepping into someone else's life is only going to work though if there is no one around that knew the original owner.&nbsp; Meeting friends and coworkers would quickly destroy the electronic fiction.&nbsp; That means it needs to be someone new in town, without a lot of people that might be checking up on him from his old life.&nbsp; He starts making plans.&nbsp; First, find someone that can modify the physical information on an existing legal id.&nbsp; Provide them with his own information, and arrange to have that incorporated into an real id, to be provided later.&nbsp; Next research the local news archives for people that died, or had serious accidents shortly after arriving in town.&nbsp; Trace where that occurred, and where they got initial treatment.</p>

		<p>Filtering that down, he locates some possible opportunities.&nbsp; Private clinics that take cases off the street, close enough to violence prone locations that people new to town might be visiting looking for some 'entertainment' without realizing how dangerous the area is.&nbsp; He spends some time carefully infiltrating the clinic nodes, setting up triggers that will notify him of the arrival of life threatening cases arriving that are close enough to his physical profile.&nbsp; He also sets up overrides, so that a death notification can be delayed, or completely suppressed from leaving the clinic node, while appearing successful to the user.&nbsp; He can not directly manipulate the government and corporate systems that store the data, but he CAN prevent them from getting updates from a few specific locations.</p>

		<p>Now the tedious boredom, with spikes of adrenalin rush when a possibility match shows up.&nbsp; Each case must be quickly researched to check the background for indications that the victim will will be missed, or an impostor recognized by someone.&nbsp; Some are easy to reject.&nbsp; The commlink records show a local address that has been used for years.&nbsp; The logs show regular chats with family.&nbsp; He was brought in by 5 coworkers that were out celebrating the new job / coworker.&nbsp; This one had a docwagon contract, and there was no way to get the physical samples replaced.&nbsp; Then there were some that looked like candidates, but the doctors where good.&nbsp; The patient survived.&nbsp; Another was DOA, and the death was recorded before he got enough information to risk delaying it.&nbsp; It would not be good to have the delays be noticed either.&nbsp; He took to haunting the clinic nodes during the prime time.&nbsp; Late evening and night, when the predators were most active, and sheep likely to be found.</p>

		<p>One night, morning actually, as he is about ready to shut down and get some sleep, a fairly young Ork is brought in unconscious to one of the monitored clinics by a local resident.&nbsp; What the cameras in the waiting area showed was enough to spur him to action.&nbsp; A check found a nice legally published commlink node.&nbsp; Listening in through the clinic sensors as he works, he learns that the Samaritan had found the vic already unconscious in an alley, with no obvious signs of violence.&nbsp; Into the commlink now, L’Autre figures a drug overdose.&nbsp; The nurse did not find a bracelet, and there was no medical contract in the commlink.&nbsp; What was in the commlink were records showing arrival at the airport yesterday.&nbsp; This was looking promising.</p>

		<p>As the nurse is rushing to get the patient to a bed and doctor, L’Autre is diving deep into the data in the Renraku Sensei.&nbsp; Hotel reservation and check-in.&nbsp; Address book.&nbsp; Not a lot there, which is good.&nbsp; Mom.&nbsp; Not good.&nbsp; Oh, but the logs do not show any recent calls.&nbsp; Personal information.&nbsp; Pictures, family, all much younger.&nbsp; Mom and just the one son.&nbsp; News clippings from a couple years ago.&nbsp; Suspected Humanis attack on family leaves 4 dead, mother and son survive.&nbsp; More recent receipt for flowers.&nbsp; That was a couple of months ago, why did he file it with the family pictures.&nbsp; Oh, funeral home, mom died.&nbsp; He must have love mommy, the receipt said the flowers were real.&nbsp; Looks like no family left then.&nbsp; What else?  Appointment for next Monday.&nbsp; Local news media manager.&nbsp; Manager?  What is he doing here instead of back in Sept-Iles?  Job Offer.&nbsp; He entered a matrix competition.&nbsp; Matrix research techniques.&nbsp; Ah, here is the submission.&nbsp; Does not seem to be exciting, nothing particularly new or innovative.&nbsp; Wonder what caught their attention?</p>

		<p>The doctor has been examining the patient, who is now hooked up to a bunch of sensors.&nbsp; He is muttering about fools that do not know their limits, and mixing alcohol with other recreational drugs.&nbsp; He tells the nurse to keep an eye on the young fool.&nbsp; And says if he wakes in the next several hours, the voluntarily consumed poisons did not manage to kill him.&nbsp; He does not sound at all sure that he will wake up.&nbsp; That is enough for L’Autre to activate the reporting delay.&nbsp; If he dies, and the id turns out to be useless, adjusting the time of death and reporting time for a case like this has minimal risk.&nbsp; The doctor is off to check on another patient.&nbsp; Searching through the commlink again, he can not find any 'in case of' contact information.&nbsp; He had been prepared to modify the information for a promising situation, but this was less risky.&nbsp; He inserted information for a distant cousin, dated it a week ago to correspond to the booking of the flight the brought him here, and pointed it to a drop box answering system he had control of.</p>

		<p>Rebooting to reset his OS for the evening, L’Autre wakes 2 sprites that have been kept on standby for just this situation.&nbsp; He gives the crack and data sprites the details collected from the commlink, then sends them off to Sept-Illes, with rehearsed instructions to find out everything they can about Jérôme, the people that know him, and are likely to try to contact him.&nbsp; The local hotel is nothing but coffins to sleep in for transients, and customers are effectively faceless.&nbsp; That can wait.&nbsp; Appointment information held in his electronic fist, L’Autre jumps to the entrance for the media node.&nbsp;  Not wanting accidents to interfere, he compiles a fresh machine sprite.&nbsp; Asking it to protect him from glitches while he works,  he hacks a mark on the host, and together they slip into the node.&nbsp; A quick check of the directory locates the managers virtual office, and he gets to work tracking from the appointment to the prepared prompter file to be used at Monday's scheduled meeting, and from there to the information they have stored about Jérôme, the job offer, and the competition.&nbsp; Turns out (no surprise) the competition was designed to show attributes they were interested in.&nbsp; They were not looking for anything flashy.&nbsp; Persistance and attention to detail were high on the priorities for the decision matrix.&nbsp; The actual competition winner was not even on the 'interesting' list.&nbsp; She had been awarded the prize with due ceremony, and appropriate human interest media attention, then filed and forgotten.&nbsp; They really wanted someone to be able to compile and organize background data related to stories that have been, or were to be published.&nbsp; Matrix grunt work, and they want someone that can do it well without getting lazy, and doing only enough to look like they are working.&nbsp; Someone that will be happy to do the scut work.</p>

		<p>Looking further, he finds that the information about their candidates contain a lot of analysis about personality traits, with a summary of scholastic achievements, but little in the way of personal details.&nbsp; The one image of his boy that he found was not recent, or very good quality.&nbsp; He filed a copy of the image on his decoy commlink.&nbsp; If everything else lined up, he would get it photoshopped, and slip it back into the files.&nbsp; Having already looked at the internal meeting information, and the resource profile they were looking for, he knew he could ace the interview / meeting.&nbsp; Without any need to sabotage the competitors.&nbsp; If he got the chance.</p>

		<p>Cleaning his virtual finger prints off of everything he had touched in the host, he exits, releases the sprite with a quick thought of thanks, and reboots.&nbsp; Just in time GOD was about to localize him.</p>

		<p>It has only been a few minutes, so he hacks his way onto the Horizon global grid and flips over to Sept-Illes to support the sprites working there.&nbsp; At that distance, the noise is bad.&nbsp; As in ugly.&nbsp; As in … Anyway, he is no use for any real matrix work, but he CAN help protect them from GOD.&nbsp; He threads a cleaner complex form, then keeps busy reducing the sprite OS.&nbsp; He is not doing anything illegal, after the initial entrance to the global grid, so as long as he keeps up with his own OS increase over time, he can focus on reducing the scores for the sprites, and let them work.</p>

		<p>Finally, the data sprite indicates completion, and he thankfully heads back to the clinic with them, to see if the effort has been wasted or not.&nbsp; The jury is still out.&nbsp; The Ork seems to have slipped into a coma, but is still breathing.&nbsp; He is exhausted himself from the near continuous use of the cleaner.&nbsp; After filing the data sprite report on the decoy commlink, he sends both sprites back on standby.&nbsp; Making sure the reporting delay is active for Jérôme, he sets a trigger to send a message code to the commlink if the clinic sensors show that the comatose patient dies.&nbsp; Back in his own meat, laying on the threadbare couch, he verifies that the message code will start an audible alarm to wake him, than staggers to the bed to get some badly needed rest.&nbsp; Very quickly he is doing his own imitation of the comatose Jérôme.</p>

		<p>Eight hours later, L’Autre wakes refreshed.&nbsp; The alarm did not go off, so Jérôme is still alive.&nbsp; There is a message in the drop box though.&nbsp; Someone at the clinic is trying to get hold of next of kin.&nbsp; The wording is professional, urgent enough to get a prompt response, but not generate immediate panic.&nbsp; A quick check of the clinic sensors and log information says any family would need to hurry to see their cousin in this world.&nbsp; Checking the time stamps, he sends a mildly alarmed message back through the messaging system, claiming work priority.&nbsp; With how little sympathy corps had for wage slaves family life, that should hold things for the day.&nbsp; He gets busy going through the information collected by the data sprite, matching it to what he found in the competition analysis.</p>

		<p>A couple of hours later, it seems that Jérôme was a bit of a loner.&nbsp; Few friends, and he cut those ties when his mother died.&nbsp; The competition and job offer were his ticket out of a bad situation and worse memories.&nbsp; No indication was found that he had even told anyone he was leaving.&nbsp; He was trying for a clean break.&nbsp; L’Autre could sympathize with the intent.&nbsp; Yesterday's premature and excessive celebration derailed the implementation.</p>

		<p>L’Autre can not really wish for the bro to expire, but he does want his own chance at getting out, and making a clean break.&nbsp; The life layed out is not one he would choose, but he can using it as a base while working to build something better.&nbsp; He spends some time pasting his own features on a copy of the saved image.&nbsp; The results are less than satisfying.&nbsp; He drops an anonymous query into a local matrix group looking for assistance for the image manipulation.</p>

		<p>A few hours later, Jérôme quietly dies, and alarms go off at several levels.&nbsp; Committing himself, L’Autre sends Jérôme’s id to the prearranged (and prepaid) matrix address, to get the profile merging started.&nbsp; He adds a note that a physical commlink with the id may be available tonight, and queries getting that patched to pass local checks, for use prior to Monday, before the other changes have filtered into the remote databases.</p>

		<p>Monday morning, wearing a freshly hacked meeting suit, the new Jérôme checks the time on his Renraku Sensei, and reviews the past few days events.&nbsp; He found someone online willing to doctor the image for a modest fee, and got it planted back in the media system node.&nbsp; A few exchanged messages, and a time was scheduled for the 'cousin' to come pickup the deceased's personal effects, and arrangements made for final disposal of the body.&nbsp; L’Autre knew, but the cousin did not let on, that the clinic had an arrangement with some ghouls to handle disposal.&nbsp; The acquired commlink was linked to a matrix address, and physical details remote modified to match his own physical profile.&nbsp; The changed physical details were slowly propagating through the identification verification databases.&nbsp; He had used the registration at the coffin hotel, and found where the remaining (not much) luggage had been temporarily stored in a locker.&nbsp; The interview suit in that was to big for him, so he found a clothing store with the same brand, and hacked the system to deliver one that fit.&nbsp; Playing safe, he wiped the tags in that outfit, and cloned the RFID tags from the original.&nbsp; The actual size was different, but the rest of the details matched.&nbsp; The shoes were a better fit.&nbsp; He had memorized the available information, and knew the contest submission by heart.&nbsp; Now he WAS Jérôme, and it was time to show his new manager that he was the perfect person for the job.</p>

		<p>Jérôme had been working in the morgue for nearly a year now, filing new information, and looking up old references as other need.&nbsp; Initially, the main challenge had been to not seem to learn too fast or do too much.&nbsp; From the profile information, he knows he is smarter than the original, and with his connection to the resonance, he could streamline what he has been asked to do.&nbsp; Instead, he carefully does the work the slow and awkward way, while learning what he can about the media industry, and appearing to match the profile the bosses expected.&nbsp; Early, he had discovered some news about research by various groups on TM abilities.</p>
