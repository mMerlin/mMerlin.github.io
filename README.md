Github pages site for user mMerlin

This is still mostly a shell.  It was created to be able to use github pages for
my (other) github projects.  I expect to expand this to provide direct access
to any project github pages, as well as directly runnable demo projects.

See the github page at http://mmerlin.github.io/
