Create a new (main?) page template file, that supports multiple bootstrap columns.  To be able to put things like projects and references into a sidebar.  At least until they get too big.  Even big, maybe accordion style open and close will be enough.

Need some simple way of letting posts use a multiple column layout.  Creating a supporting layout is not bad, but how to split to fill multiple 'content' sections with jekyll?
As long as the second/sidebar content is consistently structured, adding data to a custom variable in the front master will work.
