Here is a pdf exported from HL for my new Ork TM character.  It now seems 'complete', though I might want to tweak things as a add to his story.  If 'allowed', I would make him even younger than the 18 years old currently listed.  In SR world, how young could an Ork with a legal SIN get a job?  For the current story information, see

Build priority and karma spend information that the pdf does not show

A: Skills
B: Metatype (Ork)
C: Resonance (Technomancer)
D: Atributes
E: Resources

Karma: 26 from Base 25 + 23 negative qualities - 22 positive qualities
10 Agility 1 ==> 2
10 Reaction 1 ==> 2
6 Skills: 2 each for first rank in Cybercombat, Decompiling, Forgery

Extra note: Hero Lab seems to be running very well using wine on Fedora 21.  Even the pdf export works, though it is very slow, and does not show progress.

While looking something up, ran across this potentially use page for character creation.
