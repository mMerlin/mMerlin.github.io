I have been (bare metal) rebuilding an older Toshiba laptop as a mobile
workstation.  It is getting close to use ready now.

The base system: 4GB memory, 1TB HD, Intel Core2 Duo T5250@1.5GHz.  A bit slow,
but decent memory, and lots of HD space.  I loaded it with 64 bit Fedora 21,
plus a bunch of software for general research, note taking, and development in
several environments.

Adobe Flash
KeePass
NixNote2 to access evernote documents
Atom for general text document, source file editing
gimp
freemind
Wine
Hero Lab (for Windows)
grive to access and synchronize Google documents
Web development stuff
Google Chrome (beta)
nodejs
grunt
jekyll
autoprefixer
Pygments
jslint
jshint
